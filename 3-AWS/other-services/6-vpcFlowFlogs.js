/**
 * VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network
 * interfaces in your VPC. Flow log data can be published to the following locations: Amazon CloudWatch Logs,
 * Amazon S3, or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. After you create a flow log, you can retrieve and view
 * the flow log records in the log group, bucket, or delivery stream that you configured.

Flow logs can help you with a number of tasks, such as:

Diagnosing overly restrictive security group rules

Monitoring the traffic that is reaching your instance

Determining the direction of the traffic to and from the network interfaces
