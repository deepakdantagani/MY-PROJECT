/**
 * determines hardware of the host computer
 * each instance ffets different compute, memory and storage capabilities
 *
 * --instance types--
 * Generel perpose ==> balance of computer, memory, and network resources
 * micro instances ==> for free usage
 * compute optimized ==> they have higher ratio of vCUPs to memory. Used for CPU-bounded scaleup applications. Used for
 * high traffic front end fleets, on-demanth batch processiong, distributed analytics, web services, batch processiong,
 * high performance science and engineering applications
 * FPGS instances ==> Field-programmable gate array, for video processiong, finantial computing etc.
 * application that needs massive paraller processing power
 * GPU == high parallelized processing, including 3d grapics, media processing applications
 * machine learning
 * memory optimized ==> database applications
 * storage optimized ==> disk io, storage
