Cleaned comments:
- He was also disappointed about the volume control on the TV. He did not realize that the volume control was on the side of the Roku remote. It was about 110 degrees during his stay, if I remember correctly, so it was an usually hot August time period. The home has 3 full house HVAC systems, which is normal for a 2 story house. They are well maintained. One of these systems is fairly new. The others get checked out every year. However, we also realize that some guests want it to be cooler, so this is why we added some extra AC units to some of the sleeping areas, and one of the game rooms.
- We enjoyed our stay from start to finish! You can never be board staying at this home! Kids enjoyed the game room and pool. 10/10!
- House was great for the group we went with. Lots to do at the house so no one was sitting around bored. Pool was great to get out of the Texas heat.
- My Family and I had the pleasure of staying at this beautiful very comfortable home felt like we were right at home with so much to do with game room, pool, very comfortable and clean home we would definitely stay again if in Dallas thank you so much
- Paul’s Place was excellent, everything as pictured. Paul made great recommendations and was very responsive to questions! Everything was clean, we would stay here again!
- Had a great time. This was the perfect place for our large group.
- Wonderful stay! Lots to do and very responsive to any questions! Would def stay at again when in town!
- Paul is an amazing host. He is flexible, responsive and careful. The house is well located, with an amazing ice cream nearby. But the house need improvement. It is dated and you can feel deceived by the photos.
- Thank you for the kind words. We are so glad you enjoyed your stay. We enjoy the ice cream spot around the corner also. So glad you found it. We hope you all can come back soon. We are always striving to improve our home, thank you for the feedback.
- This home was perfect for our large family vacation. It really was like a home more than most ab&bs. All the things were there! So many touches, the pool had great shade, the outdoor seating areas were plentiful, plenty of linens, blankets, games galore! There were so many thoughtful touches! It is only 20 minutes from airport, museums, aquariums, great restaurants, all the fun stuff. Shopping areas are very close by for anything forgotten. Nice neighborhood, and the neighbor was very friendly. Host Paul was very quick to answer any questions and very helpful. If you have lots of kids or adults to entertain, this is the spot in the Dallas area.
- This is a wonderful home.

1) I had four friends flying into Dallas to visit for the weekend, could not have picked a better spot for our reunion. Thanks Paul!
2) Photos and description are pretty accurate for this home. We had a blast in the game room provided. The swimming pool and hot tub were nice. Unfriendly neighbor to the left of the home as your facing it has a shared driveway for this house. This is beyond control of the owner. Overall, I would issue a 4 out of 5 star rating. We were hesitant to use what the outside of this home has to offer after 10 PM due to possible fine of $500 for a noise complaint from the neighbors in close proximity.
3) We stayed over the Christmas holiday and our hosts set up a Christmas tree with ornaments and lights. It made us feel the spirit from the moment we walked in. They left wine and snacks for us, which was another nice touch. A list of great restaurants and activities on the fridge. We really appreciated the extra effort.
4) This house is loaded with everything for a family with children or private getaway with your significant other.
5) Clean fun house for a large group.
6) Came with family (3 kids) for Thanksgiving to have a lazy weekend and visit family. This house had so much to do for the kids. My 10-year-old would continually say "I love this house!". Arcade games, heated pool (cost, but worth it), ping pong, hot tub, etc. Came into the house with a few treats & wine for our arrival which was nice after a long travel day. Messaged Paul to say we could use some AA/AAA batteries one evening and he took the time to drop off some batteries the very next morning. Overall extremely comfortable weekend and a nice first Airbnb experience.
7) Great Stay highly recommend!!
8) Good home to stay with family and friends - lot of options inside the home to have fun. Games and pool..
9) We had a great time staying here. From the pool to all of living spaces, we were able to accommodate all of our party of 12. The pool and grilling area were especially helpful and added to our enjoyment. Would stay again when back in Dallas.

1) Great place to have a mini family reunion. Lots of rooms and very comfortable beds. Something for everyone to do. This place met or exceeded our expectations. We would definitely stay at this house again.

2) The hot tub and pool are fabulous- better than described! The host is incredibly responsive and accommodating - for those who like tv? This place has one or more in every room! We were only 6 adults and we had plenty of space. This is a space made to handle lots of people!

3) Paul’s place was great! I saw it listed on another property rental site that starts with the same letter as “vacation”, and it had additional pictures. I booked here based on the 5 bedroom description and the photos I saw of the 5 rooms on that site. When we got there, we were a bit confused and looking around for another huge room that had a wooden armoire and brown wooden queen headboard, in addition to the king master, queen guest downstairs, and 2 upstairs rooms with a double and twins in each. We couldn’t find the queen bed with wooden headboard that we saw in the photos. After a bit, we figured out that the queen bed pic is the same room as the king bed pic. We think they remodeled that room with a new king bed and furniture, but maybe forgot to delete one of the older pics of when it had the dark brown wooden furniture in it. We were still confused, though, because it was listed as 5 bedrooms. We did find a teeny tiny room upstairs that is a bit bigger than a closet, with a pull out twin made up in it. So, yes... the 5 bedroom status is correct. However, it’s just different rooms than we thought based on the pictures from the other rental site. It was okay for us and our party of 8, though. It still worked, so it wasn’t even worth getting disappointed over. The only other thing I would note is that there are no longer bunk beds in one of the upstairs rooms, where the picture of that room clearly shows bunk beds. It’s a twin day bed with trundle (in addition to a double bed). Still the same amount of beds, but my kids were a tad disappointed as we thought there were bunks. Still nothing to get upset over, though, and it was a great lesson for our kids in being flexible and grateful for what we had! And it still was a great stay! We had a great time, things were clean; we got to meet Paul when he came to clean the pool a bit and he was extremely warm, friendly, and full of great tips on dining and events in grapevine! My kids loved the pool and the arcade games, and my husband, parents, and I enjoyed hanging out and playing board games together. We had a wonderful Christmas getaway in these days of Covid. I think a photo update would be helpful for the listing, but that would be our only thing of note. Thank you so much!
