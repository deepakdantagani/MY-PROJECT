Our stay here was quiet and comfortable. I appreciate all the little things that were available to us like coffee, bug spray and laundry soap. I would stay here again and I would recommend it.

The Cabin was extremely private and so quiet with spectacular views of the lake. Had an amazing time sitting back and watching the water and exploring the property. The back of the cabin was all windows and so even on a rainy day we still had a beautiful view. The property is well cared for and the dog enjoyed exploring the various trails in the woods. Robert was extremely easy to reach and very friendly. It was an amazing trip and must see!

Robert’s a great host. His cabin is very private and peaceful. Great place to just relax and unwind. Keep in mind it is a cabin, so if bugs aren’t your thing you may want something else. All in all we enjoyed our third stay at Robert’s place. Thanks Again Robert!

This place deserves more than 5 stars! We loved everything about our stay. The house is absolutely adorable, it's the perfect size for us with everything we needed and more. The landscaping is stunning with lots of fountain grasses that rustle gently in the breeze. The HUGE deck with high quality, comfortable furniture and massive umbrella exceeded all expectations. And the swimspa is such a unique treat! We mostly used it as a mini swimming pool by lowering the temperature and taking dips throughout the day to cool off. But of course it's also a fantastic hot tub. Wifi was lightning fast and the surround-sound entertainment system made for fun movie nights after the sun went down. Robert is super responsive and accommodating. He genuinely wants his guests to have a wonderful time and it shows.

Robert's place was easy to access from the Detroit Metro Area and felt miles more away in complete solitude. We were blown away by the views and the owner clearly has put so much love and care in every modern detail from the gardens to the well placed, clutter free kitchen. The sleeping loft, lounging on the deck and the hot tub were all fantastic.

This was our second time staying at Robert’s place and it did not disappoint. The place is so beautiful and peaceful. Robert has put a lot of time and detail into the entire place. His kitchen has everything you could think of so you feel at home. His landscaping is beautifully thought out and the garden attracts beautiful butterflies, and at night the fireflies fluttering around with the wispy sounds of the grass while relaxing in the swim spa was absolutely magical . We can’t wait to stay here again!! 10/10 would recommend to friends and family!!

This place was cute, just don’t go if you fear bugs.. LOTS of spiders during the summer. Had some issues with ants getting inside as well. The fire pit area could be bigger, it was unbearable trying to sit around the fire with all the smoke coming directly at you. I’m pregnant, so my fiancé and I didn’t use the hot tub / swim spa but it was nice that it was there. The amount of bugs and spiders made us not want to sit on the patio furniture, we did bring our own camping chairs which again came in useful for the back deck but not around the fire, it’s almost like you’re expected to sit on the logs of wood which would be super uncomfortable. The inside looked just like the photos, which was nice but again had issues with ants inside by the patio doors, and when we got there there were tons of flys / flying bugs inside the place that we had to deal with. Some of the dishes weren’t cleaned, there was also a funny smell coming from the fridge. Other than that, I enjoyed the location.

We had an amazing time staying at the cabin. It was so quiet & peaceful. Nothing can beat the view…or the hot tub! Robert is an excellent host. He went above and beyond when we couldn’t figure out the TV/media system by troubleshooting over the phone. He was so helpful and genuinely wanted to make sure we enjoyed our stay. The whole check-in/check-out process was simple & smooth. Overall, our stay was relaxing and restorative. Definitely recommend this charming & cozy cabin!

A lovely slice of heaven was enjoyed at this incredible location. The water views, the birds, the swim spa and the cosy cabin with every luxurious detail not over looked was everything we needed! From the moment we pulled into the lane I was in love. If you need a nature hug this is the place to be!
We did head out to support a local restaurant one afternoon from the host’s guide book and enjoyed an eclectic lunch at The Wild Goat . The chicken & waffles as well as the fresh homemade doughnuts were amazing!

Robert's cabin was an absolute dream to stay at! The interior was so comfy and well-designed and the property was GORGEOUS – I loved sitting on the back deck to look out at the lake, hanging in the hot tub, or using the provided binoculars to do some bird-watching.
My trip revolved around watching the YouTube livestream of the Coachella music festival, and I had no problems using the lightning-fast wifi to do this. Not only that, but I was blown away by the TV's sound system. It was unreal!
All in all, 11/10 experience, and would love to come back someday!

We really enjoyed staying at this cabin. We already recommended it to friends and family. It is perfect for a remote getaway where you can disconnect from your every day busy life and get back in touch with nature. The swim spa was truly amazing, both during the day and at night with the stars (though a little tricky to figure out the swim function). The overall cabin was clean and more than adequate, though there were just a few minor cleanliness details that could have easily been cleaned ahead of time (mostly in the bathroom). Overall a great experience and would go back!

If you are looking for a quiet, relaxing and enjoyable stay, look no further. From easy check-in, to a spectacular sunrise and some new furry friends we made (saw 12 deer in total) all the amenities you could want in a weekend away look no further. The hot tub and fire place were my personal favourites. Easy to use instructions for everything. We will definitely be going back. Thank Robert ❤️ You really thought of everything!

This was our 5th time visiting the Carolinian Cottage, and it was as perfect as it was the previous 4 visits!! Robert was an incredible host, always available and responsive. The Cottage itself was comfortable, luxurious but yet still felt like a home away from home. The swim spa is so relaxing…can’t wait to visit again, hopefully in the summer months!!

Robert’s place was exceptionally quiet, peaceful and relaxing. Details are well thought of and truly made the experience feel more joyful…
Just an example, The bird feeder was full … birds were gathering… two different woodpeckers were there and you can reach to the provided Go-o-g-L-e to watch!
The swim spa was warmed and ready right at the check in time.
To make the experience even better, Robert offered us a late check out…
Thanks Robert and looking forward to visit the nest again.

The cabin was extremely comfortable and everything worked great: the TV, the soundsystem, the shower (hot water and great water pressure!), the swim spa, all the appliances, the wood burning stove, the grill - all very easy to use. Robert's communication was excellent. Highly recommend!

Had a great stay at Roberts cottage. A perfect place for a couple to get away from it all and spend time together for a few nights.
View of Lake Erie was spectacular. The giant hot tub was as well and included that view.

Second visit to this quiet little secluded cabin in the woods and my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our weekend stay.
We came in the summer and wanted to try a winter weekend. The wood burning fireplace, beautiful views, sounds of the water and lots of time spent in the hot tub were some of our favourite things.
Robert is easy to communicate with and answers any questions you may have , we believe he genuinely cares and wants you to enjoy your stay.
We will be back again this summer.

We stay at a lot of secluded cabins. This was perfect. It had everything we needed. We drove up during a bad snow storm and the host communicated the whole time. Super friendly. The location right on the water doesn't get much better, it is a get-away. We will be back and add this to our return list, magical place. And the hot-tub is massive, like... Olympic swimming pool massive. The wife and I will be back and we can't thank the host enough for setting everything up for us. Would A+++ and 10/10!

The Carolinian Cabin is absolutely magical. The cabin itself is cozy, warm, and well-appointed, with a comfy couch and mattress, good linens and lots of blankets, and great kitchen stocked with many cooking supplies. The outdoor deck boasts lots of comfy seating, and the hot tub is perfect. But the best part is the view of Lake Erie. It's mind-blowing! We sat outside all day long watching the sky change colors, the sunrise, the sunset, the moon rise, the stars, bald eagles, even a meteor! It's serene, calming, and beautiful. There are no people around, just stunning views of nature. We hope to visit in every season. Thank you!

Excellent getaway! I am picky about cleanliness and smells and linens, and this place was great. No details were overlooked by the cleaners, the hot tub seemed quite clean, and the linens were really breathable and soft. The location means fabulous wind/ breeze and the sound of constant waves outside. We slept like babies. Clean space, well organized.
Random info you may find helpful: this place has no blinds or curtains, but is very surrounded by trees and well-thought out landscaping.

Couldn’t have imagined a better place in my mind. The hot tub of course was magnificent overlooking the beautiful blue water. The bed and sheets were so comfy! This place was way more private than we realized. Not a person in sight! We really felt like we were in another country!

Robert’s place was everything we hope for and more. The location was perfect for getting away from the city and recharging our batteries.
The owner had taken the time to make sure guests were fully comfortable during their stay and the attention to detail taken by Robert was admired and appreciated. From the inside of the cabin to the landscaping and deck of the property, it was fully enjoyed. Lake Eerie was a stunning view from the property and at times we had to remind ourselves that we weren’t on the Mediterranean.
We already miss it and hope to go back sometime soon.
Thanks for a lovely stay!

Robert's place is truly spectacular. From the Lake Erie waves crashing onto the shore below as you relax in the (absolutely amazing!) hot tub, the beautiful airy breeze coming off the bluffs, the inspirational kitchen with sweet appliances and glassware, the fascinating book collection, to the soft bed and gorgeous linens...it is something else! The woods are incredibly peaceful with deer abound. Feeling so tranquil after staying here and honestly cannot wait to come back.

This place is wonderful for a peaceful couples getaway. It is super clean and is equipped with all the amenities that you could possibly need. Robert, the host, was a pleasure to communicate with too.
Highlights for us were the swim spa (it’s one thing to soak in a hot tub, but it’s a whole other experience when you get to do that and have a view of the lake and serenity of the woods and birds chirping all at once), the wraparound deck and lounging chairs, and the view!
One thing to note was that the Wifi service was blotchy so it worked ok for messaging apps on our phones but it wasn’t adequate for the streaming services offered, however that really was not an issue with all the dvds and blurays provided (over 100 options).
Definitely recommend Robert’s cabin!

This was our fourth visit to the Carolinian Cottage and yet again, it did not disappoint. So clean, well stocked and immensely comfortable. Mid May is probably our favourite time so far - the weather was so perfect, there was no need for the heat or AC -we simply opened the doors and enjoyed the weather through the screens (when we weren't in the swim spa or hanging out on the RIDICULOUSLY comfortable deck crocking chairs!). Thank you Robert for sharing this wonderful spot with us. We will definitely be back (again!)...!!

As other guests have noted, it had everything we needed for a super relaxing and comfortable stay. We were lucky with great weather and very much enjoyed making use of the BBQ, hot tub, fire place and outdoor dining. Easy drive to rondeau PP which we also enjoyed.
On the few occasions we reached out to Robert with questions he was super helpful and replied right away.
Would love to come back and experience the place in fall/winter as well. Fantastic stay!

We had an amazing long weekend at Robert's cabin. It was exactly as pictured (perhaps even better than pictured). The hot tub, lounge chairs, king size bed, and indoor fireplace made it the perfect spot for a relaxing weekend. The kitchen is well equipped and supplies were well stocked throughout the cabin. We can't wait to stay again!

Amazing setting and thoughtfully appointed place. The view is truly wonderful, and the hot tub and wood burning fireplace make it even more special. Could not ask for more.

There was great attention to detail with all the amenities. The view of the water is surreal. Pretty sure it was the biggest hot tub I've ever seen or been in. Minutes arriving we saw a deer. If you're looking for a secluded getaway from the city, this is it! The sounds of the water and birds will have you relaxing in no time.

What a beautiful private cottage In the woods. The wrap around porch was amazing and the view is breathtaking. We enjoyed the fireplace and views of the lake. Definitely recommend for anyone wanting a peaceful quiet time away. The cottage is super cute with everything you need!!

We had a fantastic stay. The place is just as advertised. Secluded and quiet, with breathtaking views. The cabin is cozy and has everything you might need (and more). Robert is a responsive and helpful host. He provides clear instructions and an easy check in and check out experience. Highly recommended. We plan to return soon!

This cabin is a fabulous find! A hidden gem that is an ideal spot for a couples getaway. Just minutes from the 401, it’s easy to find, yet secluded enough to provide total privacy in a natural sanctuary. Sitting out on the deck in the morning to view the sunrise over the water was absolutely breathtaking. Wildlife is abundant as we enjoyed watching a group of 7 foraging deer nearby, spotted several eagles overhead, and saw plenty of birds at the bird feeders that we’d never even seen before. The binoculars & bird book provided came in handy. This charming cabin is super clean & abundantly stocked with everything you could possibly need. The kitchen even has a Vitamix, an instapot, a Breville toaster and a water dispenser (just to name a few). With a wood stove indoors, an outdoor fire pit, plenty of chopped wood, multiple streaming platforms available (Netflix, Apple TV, Prime, etc.), an awesome tv & surround sound system, as well as an impressive collection of DVDs and books in the cabin, we felt spoiled! There’s plenty of additional blankets, bedding, beach towels, toiletries, water pressure, personal storage, etc. The king bed in the loft and the pillows provided were simply dreamy. The icing on the cake to this magnificent booking was definitely the heated swim spa!! We enjoyed relaxing in it while looking out at the water and also did some swimming in it. Robert was a stellar host. So helpful and kind. Answered all of our questions promptly with much detail. Check in/out was a breeze with a coded lock box and an incredibly organized book full of additional cabin instructions. We’ll definitely be booking this fantastic retreat again!

Absolutely beautiful place. Great for a couples getaway.
Nearly every detail is wonderful. It's clear Robert has put a ton of effort into crafting a great retreat.
The view overlooking the lake calls to you from every part of the home - from the bed in the loft, the kitchen, the couch, the hot tub. Its a stunning view and one you can enjoy for days.
The property is secluded and tucked deep into the woods. Not much around by way of shopping or dining outside of a small grocery and greasy dinner in Rodney. But that doesn't matter because of how wonderful the cabin is.
The kitchen has everything you need to cook all your meals (which we did). Didn't lack for a thing.
The living room has a deep and comfy couch, warm wood stove for those cool spring days, and a massive TV with superb sound system. Watching movies with this entertainment center in such a small cabin is amazing. Also, connect your phone by bluetooth and blast your music throughout your stay.
The bed in the loft is great. Although be warned that the stairs up and down to the loft require decent mobility.
And of course the hot tub is huge and so worth it. We enjoyed it a couple times every days (sunrise, sunset, and sometimes in-between).
Five stars! No complaints. Hope to be back.

This place is definitely far above the average experience. A neat kitchen, incredible swim spa, wood stove, and great deck, all perched on a bluff over the lake … pretty incredible. The host is also friendly, responsive and clearly takes good care of the property. 5 ⭐️

My boyfriend and I had a fantastic stay!
The views were amazing, and waking up to the sound of birds never got old. We both love to cook so the full kitchen was perfect. Robert was a fantastic host and we would love to come back again.

Had such a nice and relaxing stay at this cozy little spot. Great property, large hot tub and especially loved the fireplace in the cool summer months. There doesn’t seem to be many restaurants nearby but a sizeable kitchen with all the appliances you need. BBQ outside is a bonus. Would recommend this place in a heartbeat!

This is our third time at Robert's beautiful quiet getaway and it was as perfect as the first 2 times. The kitchen is perfectly stocked, the entertainment system is terrific and the bed is crazy comfortable...the place is clean, modern but yet so warm and inviting all at the same time! We spent our time either in the swim spa watching the ice melt off of the leaves above us, or inside curled up on the couch with a warm fire and a glass of wine...A perfect place to escape the city and feel like you're away from it all. We're already planning our next summer trip, where we look forward to watching the bees in the plants while sipping wine in the swim spa. We've had the pleasure now of enjoying almost every season here...just missing autumn, which I am pretty excited to see next year!!

This is a great little getaway in an unexpected place. Perfect for a couple or two looking for some peace and quiet without sacrificing any comforts or amenities. Pictures are very accurate and it's stocked with everything you would need. The hot tub is comically large and luxurious. Worth the drive.
