I was surprised on how well the house was equipped. There were actually extra garbage bags even! And there were more kitchen items than I was expecting; they said it was a full kitchen, but you never know until you are there. And they even had spices, and coffee pods ready to be used. There were lots of towels too. We had everything we needed to cook a Thanksgiving Dinner for our kids that go to UTA and couldn't come home to Houston.
It was nice being at a place where they didn't hide everything. And some of the Roku apps were already ready to go without me having to mess with signing in just to watch a couple of Disney shows. Most of the TVs are larger than my own. I also like that the thermostat wasn't locked away.
We even roasted smores in the backyard firepit every night. Good memories.

The place was very clean, quiet, convenient and relaxing. I slept like a baby in bed and the couch in the living room was very cozy. I will stay here again, no doubt.

Response from Sharon

Sharon
Hi Jackie, I do apologize as I am also terrified of those palmetto bugs. Just wanted to clarify to future guests that our guests did have a great stay, but in Texas, we do get palmetto bugs (aka cockroaches) from outside/drain. This is not an infestation as these bugs can get into any pristine clean home even though we have our home treated regularly by a pest control company.

Over all no complaints, extremely worth the price. Everything was just as described. Instructions for check in were spot on.

It also had everything we needed (minus an iron). We really enjoyed all the games indoors and outside as well. Sharon promptly responded to all my messages.

Sharon was extremely responsive and helpful throughout the process. We requested an early check-in and had a few minor questions that were all dealt with immediately. The house is exactly as shown and worked great for our group of 4. We wanted to be close to AT&T Stadium and in that sense the house was perfect - barely a 10-minute walk. Two minor things - the house is a bit dark without a ton of natural light (no big deal), and there's not a lot of restaurants, bars, stores, etc. within walking distance. That's fine but we chose not to rent a car since we were so close to the stadium. So something to keep in mind. Overall it was a really great stay and weekend.

This place is beautiful and located perfectly. I was really happy with the price and amount of sleeping places there were. Sharon responds quickly to any questions. 10/10 would recommend.

This Airbnb is perfect! We had an emergency where we needed to find an Airbnb ASAP and Sharon saved the day! She was very communicative and accommodating. The house was very clean and had everything we needed! Would definitely stay here again

Absolutely loved our stay here! Incredibly close to the stadium, super easy walk to avoid the crazy traffic at the cowboys game. Comfy beds, super communicative, and nice backyard area! We appreciated the extra touches including a ton of extra blankets / towels, a fully stocked kitchen with every appliance and coffee pods, and incredibly simple self check in process. Would definitely stay again!

This is a nice home in a convenient location. It’s only a 12 minute walk to the AT&T stadium! The backyard is a nice area to lounge and has a large table perfect for an outdoor meal. There is also plenty of space for parking. The response time from the host is fast and the check in process was easy. Would definitely stay here again!
