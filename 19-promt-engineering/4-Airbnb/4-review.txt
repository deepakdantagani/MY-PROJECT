Paul was very responsive and a wonderful host that went above and beyond. We had a family gathering and it was a lovely space to bring everyone together. We were able to use the grill, the pool, and the jacuzzi. We had a great stay.

Upon arrival, the house seemed very cozy and private. When we entered, it was way bigger than what it looked like on the outside! There were so many entertainment activities and very spacious rooms. Little toiletries were accommodated to us, plenty of towels, blankets, even metal sticks for smores! Everything was perfect and the house was extremely clean. Paul was an awesome host and responded very quickly if I had any questions. They also provided a full page of restaurants, or other places to visit around Dallas/nearby. I’m so appreciative to have stayed here and I’d highly recommend it!

Although the property was outdated and needs some upgrades it was serviceable for myself and family for a 4 night stay.
Cons: Pool table broken, house had a unpleasant smell upon entry. We had to use a lot of air freshener to get rid of the odor. The bathroom in the master bedroom was not flushing properly. If you bring seniors to stay in this house beware this house is not handicap accessible. There are no safety rails in the showers. The patio furniture and the gas grill was not cleaned and ready for guest. I recommend better pictures to give an accurate view of the bedrooms and the outside pool/patio area.
Pros: The pool was the best entertainment amenity. The neighborhood is quiet. Paul is a great host and had immediate response time when needed. There are plenty of towels and blankets.
Overall, I enjoyed my stay. The house is good for short family stays.

We are very thankful for the guests who come back to stay at our house, year after year. The pool table was fine, last time I used it. A guest moved it awhile back, and I had to re-level it, and when I cleared the table, it seemed find to me. I'm assuming that the smell you mentioned was from us painting the inside of the house. We had blocked some days to finish painting the inside of the house, a few weeks back. This is a two story home, so I don't know why you would think its handicap accessible, we surely don't advertise it, as that. Our housekeeper has a checklist, and it shows they cleaned the outside furniture. This year we have spent almost $40,000 in repairs, maintenance, new arcade games, and improvements. So this is a typical year, from a maintenance and improvement standpoint.

Paul is a great host and did everything to make us feel welcome and handle the issues we encountered. The house is quite old and looks the part on the outside. The price is high compared to other homes in the area that are newer. Many amenities; however, expect some things not to work. If wifi goes down, you’ll have no tv or streaming capability either besides lacking internet. Airconditioning system in the home is a blanket of patches with home hvac, window ac’s upstairs and in garage and portable unit in game room, all combined with ceiling fans and portable fans. All systems together could barely keep house cool. We had a good time, but were a bit disappointed for the offering compared to the price paid per night. For the price we have to say it is just satisfactory. At a lower price the expectations probably would have been lower and therefore maybe the rating would be higher. Thanks for having us and good luck with your future endeavors.

This guest was disappointed that the internet went down for about a half hour. But once his son rebooted the router, it came right back up. Unfortunately, sometimes the internet has issues.
He complained about a arcade game not working, but when I sent my handyman over, he said it worked fine. He even had a housekeeper try it, and she had no problems either. He was also disappointed about the volume control on the TV. He did not realize that the volume control was on the side of the Roku remote. It was about 110 degrees during his stay, if I remember correctly, so it was an usually hot August time period. The home has 3 full house HVAC systems, which is normal for a 2 story house. They are well maintained. One of these systems is fairly new. The others get checked out every year. However, we also realize that some guests want it to be cooler, so this is why we added some extra AC units to some of the sleeping areas, and one of the game rooms.

This home was perfect for our large family vacation. It really was like a home more than most ab&bs. All the things were there! So many touches, the pool had great shade, the outdoor seating areas were plentiful, plenty of linens, blankets, games galore! There were so many thoughtful touches!
It is only 20 minutes from airport, museums, aquariums, great restaurants, all the fun stuff. Shopping areas are very close by for anything forgotten.
Nice neighborhood, and the neighbor was very friendly. Host Paul was very quick to answer any questions and very helpful.
If you have lots of kids or adults to entertain, this is the spot in the Dallas area.

The house was perfect for big group and a lot of activities to keep children/teenagers entertained. Salted water pool was clean and warm (love the chlorine free smell). We didn’t get a chance to use the hot tubs. The master room in the main floor is huge with room for 2-3 folding single bed (the house has a lot of extra folding single bed). Second bedroom on the main floor is roomy with a queen bed. There are 2 additional bedrooms upstairs each has a double and at least one to two singles. There’s an additional smaller bonus room with a single bed upstairs. In short, there’s no shortage of bed in the house if you have a large group. Only 5 min from the airport and in a very quiet neighborhood. The house and furniture are little dated but well maintained. It’s definitely a great fit for multi family with children. The host is very responsive.

There is only one way out to the pool with child locks and we felt very safe with our three grandkids there. There is plenty of room and the kids enjoyed the arcade games. The big kids did too! It was a great place to stay and appreciate Paul going beyond to mail us back clothes that were left in the dryer. We certainly appreciate it!! :)

Paul was very responsive the entire time, the entry into the home was easy and the home was clean. It did have a little smell to it maybe because it’s an older house or there was some water damage through out it. The amenities were as describe huge game room with more in the garage. Overall my family of 11 had a decent time, my only cons is the hot tub water had a smell to it so we didn’t really use it and the pool was deep. Not very relaxing for ppl that cannot swim because the drop off happens very quickly. I do feel like I shouldn’t have paid for it to be heated because we couldn’t really use it with the kids like we wanted to. But I would rent Paul’s property again, clean, roomy, great game room, friendly neighbor. Nice location to a lot of areas in Dallas.

Paul was always quick to reply to any questions we had prior to checking in. During our stay the responses were even faster. The house had everything we needed for our group of 9. We especially enjoyed the pool and outside spaces. They had everything we needed to cook and all the little things that are sometimes forgotten. The house is dated and the pictures flatter the space somewhat. With a few easy fixes this would be ideal for the price and the location. I discussed these with Paul and he informed me that it was already on his radar. Other issues that we had would be with Airbnb and not the host. Overall it was almost perfect.

Photos and description are pretty accurate for this home. We had a blast in the game room provided. The swimming pool and hot tub were nice. Unfriendly neighbor to the left of the home as your facing it has a shared driveway for this house. This is beyond control of the owner. Overall, I would issue a 4 out of 5 star rating. We were hesitant to use what the outside of this home has to offer after 10 PM due to possible fine of $500 for a noise complaint from the neighbors in close proximity.
Response from Paul
January 2023
Paul
That neighbor has never complained, in 7 years, except for when someone blocked his separate driveway. He has a driveway, and we have a driveway, and The driveways are connected, but separate. Every Airbnb we have stayed at has asked that we be quiet outside, after 10 or 11pm. I don't think that is a unreasonable request, as most people have to go to work in the morning.

Came into the house with a few treats & wine for our arrival which was nice after a long travel day.
Messaged Paul to say we could use some AA/AAA batteries one evening and he took the time to drop off some batteries the very next morning.

Amazing house! We were a group of 14 adults and 3 children and this house had more than enough space! The living room is spacious and very comfortable. The game room kept the kids entertained when it wasn’t time to swim. When it was time to swim the whole family really enjoyed the pool. There are three grills. One charcoal grill, one propane and a griddle. The pool is huge and deep and came with tons of pool floats. Great seating under shade by the pool. There were plenty of extra roll away cots that were surprisingly comfortable as well as plenty of extra linens and pillows and blankets. The house came with a pack and play, high chair and an awesome little baby swing/cradle. Master Bedroom was phenomenal with side access to the pool. Every room had a TV with streaming access. Even the smallest bedroom. That was a big plus. Neighbors didn’t bother us at all. We had a small speaker playing music and kids were being kids and screaming by the pool and no one had an issue with it at all. We felt as if we were at home in our own backyard. Kitchen was pretty much fully equipped for all of our needs. Washer and dryer equipped with detergent and dishwasher equipped with soap pods. Jacuzzi was a great addition as well. Easy access to the kitchen for wine refills when needed. Paul was great at communicating when we had questions.

This is definitely an entertainment house. The 2 teens and 9 year old had tons of fun, they loved the pool and the video games. When we walked in we were greeted with all the light on and TVs on ready to entertain. This home was well stocked with most of your needs, the shampoo was not great but they had some and it worked. This home comes with every streaming service, tons of board games and books as well. Something for everyone! If I was a wine drinker I would of drank the complimentary wine. Thank you for that. Very comfortable beds and sofas. What else can I say this place was great!

The gas was turned off in middle of our stay. The owner worked diligently to get it back on in a timely manner but then forgot to turn on the hot water heater. We also had to ask for more toilet paper and didn't know where to find additional bath towels. Then to top all of that off, the oven didn't work. Hot tube, pool, game rooms are set up nicely. Yet every email you receive from them say in bold print "NO PARTIES" All I could do was laugh at that.

This guest reserved the home for 11 guests, and we put out 2 rolls of TP for each guest in the reservation. They had many more cars than they told us also.
Unfortunately, they did not let us know that they were going to have many more than 11 guests. After we asked if there is anything else we could get them, they asked for more TP, which we immediately (within an hour) brought over another 24 rolls. After the vendor fixed their mistake, we immediately turned on the hot water heater. So I have to disagree with almost everything thing she wrote in her review. Including the towels, there was a dozen unused towels in various bathroom cabinets. We understand, when there are 4 bathrooms, there are are many cabinets to look in. We also keep many towels in one of the closets too. If she would have asked, we could have told her exactly where the extra towels were. Oh, and we baked pizzas in the oven after they checked out, so not sure what they did wrong with the oven. There is also a microwave and a convection oven, that work perfectly fine, in the kitchen. We would definitely not host this guest again, for a long list of reasons.

We had a great time at Paul's. The place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. When we first stumbled upon this house on AirBnB, it seemed almost too good to be true. There must be a catch! But everything was as perfect as it seemed online.
 Paul is incredible. He was very accommodating and very quick to respond with any questions. He is also flexible with check-in and check-out time, which was extremely helpful. The place was very clean and had all of the necessities for a few night stay.
Would absolutely recommend to stay there 👍🏽

The minute my family and I arrived we noticed a foul smell in the house. We
went to the store and came back the smell was still there. I proceeded to put the groceries away - inside the cabinets were so dirty I could not put my groceries away. The dining room table was so wobbly and the wood was so discolored we couldn’t even eat at the table. When I went upstairs I couldn’t take the smell any longer so I sent the Host a message. Paul called right away and suggested to send over housekeeping. At this point I was so discussed with the smell. I advised Paul I refuse to stay here. I contacted Airbnb team to let them know I’m taking my family and we had to relocate somewhere else. My advise to Paul. Please put some time in improving your Airbnb and please double check with housekeeping to make sure they are doing their job!!! I lost out on some of money. My family health is very important to me so I did what I felt was best for my family! I also took pictures of everything. I thought Airbnb is the new error. I may go back to booking hotels.

The reason this house has roughly 150 PLUS five star reviews is that we have an amazing housekeeping team who work incredibly hard to make sure everything is perfect. When they get done cleaning the home, we go through the home to make sure everything is great. Before this guest arrived, we had 5 people (2 were contractors) who worked on the home, and none of us smelled any kind of odor. Unfortunately, this guest did many unethical things, and we hope they stay in hotels, because no host will put up with the stuff they tried to pull. As a host, we have had a 5 figure number of stays at our homes, and I have never seen anyone do what they did. Thankfully, this is the first time we have run into a guest like this. As they say, there is always going to be that one person out of a thousand who makes you wonder, "what the heck".

This is the PERFECT house for a big group, especially if there are kids! Our kids stayed busy all week between the arcade games and the pool, and they were exhausted every day.
The adults really enjoyed that the house was big enough for us to getaway from the kids as needed, and even with three families staying together, we all had plenty of space and privacy.
The location is great, and super close to plenty of shopping and dining. Paul was extremely responsive and available if we needed anything.
Highly recommend this place!

We found plenty of entertainment options for all age groups. The owner was kindly receptive to any concerns or questions during our stay. Bringing your own pool towels ( if you have a large group) would be helpful. Also, if you are planning to do a lot of home cooking, ask if they have whatever special pans you may want. (Local family brought over a larger pan and an iron skillet for a special recipe we wanted to cook.) We also enjoyed the complimentary wine that was provided.

We were a family of 6, however this house is MUCH better suited for a large family reunion or gathering. It's an older pier and beam home with beautiful real wood floors in a fairly nice area with nosey and sometimes noisey neighbors :) The pool was immaculate, although mosquitoes were a definite problem that should be addressed. Definitely pay to heat the pool, was well worth it b/c the pool is SO nice. Washer/ dryer in game room which was VERY nice to deal with wet towels and swim suits. Take extra towels for a large family, there are a few but not as many as this property requires. Many many beds = not very comfy beds (squeeky springs built into bed frames). Bed were perfectly adequate, however. Lots of seating in den for large families. Look at pics CLOSELY and realize a professional took them, things are not where you think they are. Pics are accurate, but slightly misleading to the eye/mind. 2 bedrooms downstairs and 2 bedrooms and storage closet with a bed upstairs. Baby gate at top of stairs but not at bottom. 3yo could go up without help, but not down without help. Kitchen is not as big as it appears. Many small appliances, but sparsely equipped with staples....plan accordingly. Kitchen floor is dangerous when wet, tiles are highly glossy. Trash bags were supplied, but only half a roll of paper towels and no dish cloths. Take ziplock bags, towels and cheap lidded containers with you if you plan to do much cooking! Game rooms were ok, some of the stand alone games did not seem to work quite right, but our 3yo didn't care. We didn't use the garage game room, but the pool table and Foosball table looked nice. Never found the bikes, but we didn't ask either. Lots and lots of tables and chairs for meals, mostly bar height. That was a drawback for us, but for a large family, likely fine. Most of the seating around the pool needs a thorough cleaning and overhaul. We used the hot tub only once because it's not where you think it is. We chose this house for the layout and pool and while the layout was slightly different than anticipated, it worked out fine and we loved the pool. I cannot stress enough how clean and clear the pool is. Maintenance on the pool was done twice during our 7 days. House rules were easily observed and not overly intrusive. As a family of 6 we wouldn't book again, but definitely would book it for a large family gathering - it would be perfect!!

This house was a WIN for our family. With a teen and young adult under one roof again this place offered them the flexibility to be autonomous and to work/play together at the same time. Love the way the garage was converted into a game room. From billiards to darts, we were not bored. Definitely appreciated the added touch of the wall unit air conditioner in the garage.  The old school arcade games were a hit for my husband and I. We were able to show our kids that we had Galaga and PacMan skills😁. Every few hours, we had a new ping pong champion.
Although it was only four of us, this home could accommodate a family with many children or a large family gathering, especially after the pandemic.
We were able to spend a great bit of our time there in the pool. Lovely! Plenty of floaties, if needed. The diving board was an added bonus. The pool is deep, so you will appreciate the child door locks on both doors leading to the pool. (One is a door off of the master bedroom. Nice!)
Taught our kids how to play Black Jack. Appreciated the bottles of wine throughout the home.
The hot water heater and water pressure was great.
Different zones for air conditioning throughout the house. Nice touch!
Each room has it's own TV system/ Roku, etc...
Ideal house for teenagers... All day, all night.
Ideal home for adults.
Ideal home for tons of fun and family time.

Great house with lots to do. Fun everywhere you look. Only complaint is the furniture shown and layout from the listing are inaccurate. The bunk beds were downgraded to roll out cots. Some furniture in the pics isn't at the houselike the couch by the pool table, some beds, etc. When contacted the host he disregarded the complaint. All in all a good location but we would have chosen a different place if the images were accurate. A little false advertising but no biggie.

With all of the house rules this guest broke, we wish he had stayed at another property. I take exception to almost everything he wrote. Why? We have put in about $30,000 in upgrades and home improvements in the end of 2020, and the beginning of 2021. New furniture, new games, new amenities, and the list goes on and on. Maybe this is why our guests keep coming back, and staying again and again!

Paul’s place was great! I saw it listed on another property rental site that starts with the same letter as “vacation”, and it had additional pictures. I booked here based on the 5 bedroom description and the photos I saw of the 5 rooms on that site. When we got there, we were a bit confused and looking around for another huge room that had a wooden armoire and brown wooden queen headboard, in addition to the king master, queen guest downstairs, and 2 upstairs rooms with a double and twins in each. We couldn’t find the queen bed with wooden headboard that we saw in the photos. After a bit, we figured out that the queen bed pic is the same room as the king bed pic. We think they remodeled that room with a new king bed and furniture, but maybe forgot to delete one of the older pics of when it had the dark brown wooden furniture in it. We were still confused, though, because it was listed as 5 bedrooms. We did find a teeny tiny room upstairs that is a bit bigger than a closet, with a pull out twin made up in it. So, yes...the 5 bedroom status is correct. However, it’s just different rooms than we thought based on the pictures from the other rental site. It was okay for us and our party of 8, though. It still worked, so it wasn’t even worth getting disappointed over.
The only other thing I would note is that there are no longer bunk beds in one of the upstairs rooms, where the picture of that room clearly shows bunk beds. It’s a twin day bed with trundle (in addition to a double bed). Still the same amount of beds, but my kids were a tad disappointed as we thought there were bunks. Still nothing to get upset over, though, and it was a great lesson for our kids in being flexible and grateful for what we had! And it still was a great stay!
We had a great time, things were clean; we got to meet Paul when he came to clean the pool a bit and he was extremely warm, friendly, and full of great tips on dining and events in grapevine! My kids loved the pool and the arcade games, and my husband, parents, and I enjoyed hanging out and playing board games together.
We had a wonderful Christmas getaway in these days of Covid.
I think a photo update would be helpful for the listing, but that would be our only thing of note.
Thank you so much!

This home has everything you need for a family trip, work trip, or fun getaway. Although we didn’t have children with us during our stay, If you do, they will never be bored! So many fun games and extras for everyone, at any age.
The beds are so comfortable! There is so much room and no matter where you sleep you are guaranteed a comfortable bed.

Paul communicated well from the beginning until the end. The house had everything we needed. The children enjoyed the pool and the arcade. They didn't want to leave. We stay in Airbnbs often, this house will be one of our favorites. It was worth the price, especially if you have a large group. It was only 6 of us but the house has several beds and alot of space.

Beautiful home with tons of things to keep everyone entertained, the pool alone makes this house a excellent choice. The kitchen is beautiful with great appliances and plenty of utensils, pots, pans to cook for a group. T.V.s in every room, pool table, ping pong table, arcade games and much more just for entertainment. Wonderfully laid out bed rooms with very comfortable beds, the layout of the house isnt the most open concept but it hits all the things you need during a stay!

The rooms were spaced out well and there TV's all over so you'll never get bored. It was only 10-15 minutes to the airport and 20-30 minutes into downtown.

This house is awesome and huge! We comfortably slept 15 adult men for 4 nights and had plenty of room. There is a TV in almost every room. Heck, some even have two!
The heated saltwater pool is huge and our group loved the hot tub. Our nerdy group especially appreciated the Mortal Kombat arcade cabinet. You could spend an entire week at this place, never leave, and still have things to do.
Paul is an expert at his craft. He took us through the house, set us up with everything we needed, made recommendations about local spots, and was always super responsive when we had questions. He even took time after our stay to get us a jacket we forgot in the AirBnB.
We had a fantastic time at this place and can’t wait to stay again!

Excellent space for large groups. The house itself is rather straight forward. The master bedroom is very nice. The rest are very utilitarian and unadorned, but that’s totally all they need to be. Paul left many nice touches throughout the space including things like K cup coffee (plus teas, sugars, creamers, etc) and tons of fun games (ping pong, shuffleboard, etc). And more TVs than we knew what do to with!
The highlight, of course, is the pool. We spent tons of time enjoying the gorgeous weather, grilling, listening to music, and floating in the warm saltwater pool.
The only thing I caution large groups on (especially if you’re used to cities that don’t sprawl as much as the greater Dallas-Fort Worth region) is to be aware of distance. If you have a large group and anticipate spending a lot of time in Dallas, you would honestly be better off just splurging the extra money to go stay in Dallas. The 30 minute car ride is pretty cumbersome — especially if (a) you plan on drinking (b) you have a large group that might want to come and go at different times or (c) you plan on taking Lyfts/Ubers (which get to be very expensive very quickly).
That said, If your plan is to check out Irving or to just crash at the Airbnb, this place was absolutely incredible and worth every penny!

Response from Paul

Paul
For many years we have had a contract with a local professional pest control company, and they service our home, inside and out, on a very regular basis. When I saw this review, I asked my lead housekeeper if she has been seeing any insects or anything, and she said no. I also asked my other housekeeper if she has seen any issues, and she also said no. So I really have a hard time believing any of this, especially since the pest control company was just there prior to this guest. If this was true, I don't believe we would have so many returning guests.

There were a crazy amount of towels available, 6 extra cots. Modern kitchen and 2 dryers as well. You can tell Paul is a veteran host. There was candy and wine in all the rooms thoughtfully displayed and anything you could need was just in the next drawer. The man even back ups for back up on some stuff. Highly recommend and would go here again.

The pool and hot tub were nice, and we enjoyed some family competition on the games around the house. We would recommend this house for any groups heading to Dallas looking for a great house to stay in. Super convenient to DFW as well for all of the arrivals and departures of various people at all different times.

Paul
Thank you for staying in our home. We are sorry that you were not happy with the home. We do try to accommodate our guests special requests and remedy any concerns ASAP. When you informed us that you could not find a tea kettle that you liked, housekeeping immediately delivered another one to you (even though there was at least one already one there in the kitchen). When you informed us the hot tub was not to your liking, we immediately arrived only to find out your kids had turned it down to 59 degrees. When you informed us there was some water on the deck of the pool, we immediately addressed your concern. I have no idea how many dozens of guests you had staying at our home, but I’m sure this was a record high guest count, based upon what housekeeping kept telling me. As to the beds, you never mentioned anything during your stay. We have actually had dozens of guests ask us where we got the mattresses, because they were so comfortable.

Paul's place is misrepresented as a house on Airbnb. It is more like a resort! Everywhere we turned were amenities and little details to make our stay wonderful. There was wine and candy waiting upon our arrival along with a selection of our favorite cokes in the fridge. The place was huge, the beds were comfortable, the pool was downright amazing, and I have never seen so many televisions. So many linens! Paul's communication was superior. He checked on us every single morning.
When we were preparing to leave, we broke the coffee table (long story), and Paul was kind and obliging about the cost of a replacement, even though it obviously was a huge inconvenience for him to have to purchase a new coffee table for a quick turnaround for the next guests later the same day. Paul even negotiated a better deal on the new table and he never made me feel like a louse for breaking it and making his job as host that much more stressful.
Ten out of ten. Stay here.

With all of the outdoor lights around the back yard and swimming pool, it can attract some mosquito and bugs during the summer. This is why we provide our guests with the citronella candles and the tiki bamboo Luau torches with citronella, to help keep those pesky mosquitoes away.

Paul was a great host. He was there to greet us when we arrived and showed us around the house. The students we brought had a great time. There was so many things to do in the house. We played darts and ping pong, and other games as well as swimming in the pool and enjoying the hot tub. There was plenty of room for all of us. Thanks so much Paul! This is a great place to stay and when we are back this direction we will be looking for this home again. Thanks Paul! Janell

10/10 - would definitely stay again at Paul’s place.
Our team of 27 were able to fit and function almost perfectly within the space.
Paul supplied things we didn’t know we needed, or things we forgot, like water bottles, tooth brushes, and even games.
Our gymnastics team loved the pool & hot tub - a unique touch to our trip to Texas for a competition.
Thanks for everything!

Great space for large parties and kids as well. Paul was super helpful from booking until check out, and went above and beyond to ensure our stay was pleasant. We didn't have the best weather, so we used the pool maybe once, but it was nice having the fire pit outside. The place is definitely "lived in"--don't expect an ultra modern or chic interior, but for the value and all the fun amenities, it may be worth it! Thanks Paul for all of your help and hospitality!

Poul place was a fun retreat. Lots of bedrooms and baths for a larger group. But also lots of fun to entertain them with while you are there. The pool looked really nice, but we didn't try it in the colder weather. Some of us did use the hot tub which was relaxing. There was ping pong, pool table, and other large games.
Paul welcomed us himself and showed us around answering all of our questions. He will let you know great places in the area to visit while you are there.

Stayed with kids
We had a great time here. Stayed with three families with young children...plus 1 extra adult. All together we had 7 adults, 6 kids + two infants. We all had plenty of space and there were several roll away beds that we didn’t even end up using. Dining space worked well to have a kitchen table for all the kids and another large dining table for adults.
Best part about this place were all the games and entertainment inside the house. This was a place we could all meet and stay for the holidays and it was SUPER cold outside the whole time. I was worried about getting stir crazy with everyone stuck inside but we had a blast. Ping pong, shuffleboard, pool table, foosball, hot tub...really was fun.
Several restaurants and shops are nearby. Probably a 5-10 minute drive to go grab the basic necessities. You can grab beer and wine less than a mile away and the closest liquor store is at least 15-20 min away. Further out are tons of activities for adults and kids...and really good restaurants. Host left a long list of recommendations and took time at check in to walk us through the whole house and answer any questions.
Host was incredibly hospitable and dropped off extra firewood and drinks for us the second night. Loved having some breakfast and drinks in the fridge waiting when we arrived so we didn’t have to think about going to the store right when we got there.
Paul was easy to communicate with and any suggestions I had he made sure to address quickly. Some fights were on Pay Per View one of the nights and we couldn’t find a way to buy them on our own. We were able to purchase through the hosts’ system easily and pay him back...much appreciated!!Plenty of parking. This is a residential neighborhood and neighbors are very friendly.
Would definitely come and stay again. Thanks again Paul!!

Paul is a fantastic host. We have stayed at Air BnBs all over the world and this was by far the best. We had a large 3 generational family group here for Christmas. It was just perfect for the whole family. Paul even put up a Christmas tree for us aand dropped off a Christmas care package on 25 December Many nice extra touches like a stocked fridge ,snacks, candy wine and beer too. The game room was a big hit and got lots of play. It was too cold for the pool but it looks great. Thanks so much Paul!!

Paul's place was absolutely lovely! He is very quick to respond and accommodating. There were so many extra touches — Netflix, a pool, the playroom, coffee, and drinks — we felt very spoilt. It's a great house for a family vacation — especially if you're a large group. The kitchen was really well designed and inspired my mother-in-law to make pies from scratch for us. I highly recommend Paul's place if you're in the Dallas area. We would definitely rebook it the next time we are.

11 of my friends and us went down to Dallas for a friends wedding and stayed at Paul's place. This is an outstanding listing! The location was super close to the wedding and reception and also was not far from many activities we did, such as downtown and the outlet mall. The house was large and all 12 of us comfortably stayed for 3 nights. The house is equipped with so many activities and amenities like the pool, hot tub, ping pong table, etc. This made the stay that much more enjoyable. Paul was always very quick to respond and ensured we had everything we needed. He communicated openly with the other guests which was awesome as I was the last to arrive out of all my friends. Paul also stocked the fridge and made sure the house had all the necessities. If you're looking for a place in Dallas I highly recommend you staying here. This has been one of the greatest airbnb experiences for me. All the other guests that stayed in the house this weekend would also agree.

Paul’s place worked out perfect for us. We are a family group of ladies that were in town for wedding dress shopping in the Dallas area. We loved the fact that it was close to the Dallas Fort Worth airport. The patio and pool area were a beautiful, peaceful place to chat in the evening. The pool table, foosball table and shuffle board were a blast! Paul asked ahead of time our preference of drinks and had the fridge stocked for us. He took the time to bring over a portable crib and even bought a high chair when we asked for one. The place was a great value! Would definitely stay there again.

We booked Paul's house for us and family coming in from out of town for our wedding. The location and house were both beautiful. There were so many options as far as sleeping accommodations go, which we were very thankful for. The pool, hot tub, and game room were more than enough for entertainment of all ages and tastes, and yet there were still more options available there. Paul was an amazing host, he met us and showed us around, stocked the house, gave us restaurant suggestions, and had plenty of resources for things to do in the area. He was always a phone call or text away, and ready to help should we need anything. I can't think of any suggestions I could make to improve upon the experience. Of all the stressful things that weekend, this was smooth sailing... by far the most satisfying reservation I've made.

Paul's house is located in a nice quiet neighborhood, allowing easy access to anything a family would need. Paul was an amazing host who communicated the entire way from check-in to check out; and even asked us what beverages and snacks we would like before our arrival! The house feels much bigger as it has numerous "extra" spaces and has a layout that allows your family to spread out and not feel like they are on top of each other. the pool and hot tub again created additional space for family activities. Our host provided a comprehensive tour of the house, amenities, area activities, and was incredibly responsive if we had questions during our stay.
We will definitely be renting this place again on our next trip!

If you need a family-friendly place to stay, this house is a great price for a larger family.

We had seven adults, three kids and one infant and there was more than enough bedrooms and bathrooms to accommodate.

This was our first Airbnb experience and I fear that Paul may have set the bar unrealistically high. He was so accommodating, stayed in constant communication and went the extra mile to make us comfortable. He provides a well stocked kitchen with plenty of snack and cold drinks, he even went out of his way to find a great local craft beer for us. There were plenty of spare linens, air mattresses, and way more clean towels than we could use in a weekend. He also provided a two page guide with restaurant and shop recommendation and instructions on how to use the electronics. The bathrooms were equiped with shampoo and conditioner, hair dryers and were nice and tidy. The neighborhood was quiet close to many nearby restaurants and grocery stores, and centrally located to everywhere we wanted to go in the DFW area. Just a 15 minute drive to downtown Dallas for the nightlife, 20 minutes to AT&T stadium, and 10 minutes to the airport.

I came to DFW with a party of 14 other people for a conference at the Gaylord Texan. None of us have ever reserved an Airbnb before, but given the circumstances, Airbnb was our only choice. Paul made this first experience absolutely exceptional. His communication, hospitality, and commitment to the us was second to none, and he came off very friendly and welcoming! He will go out of his way and swing by the house daily to replenish the fridge and pantry, take out the trash, and provide towels. Our party spent entire days, everyday, at the conference, and he'd notify me of an upcoming visit and ask if he could get anything for us, and sure enough he delivered! To provide this much service at an unbeatable Airbnb price, I don't think I'd consider staying anywhere in DFW but at Paul's home!

Thanks for everything, Paul. Your attention to the details and going the extra mile were noticed and very much appreciated! We had a lovely Christmas family get-together at your house.
I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a fully stocked house. The game room and wet bar were a big hit with kids and adults alike. At the drop of a hat, Paul went out and bought shuffle board "sand" and delivered it immediately to us!
The kitchen was big and fully stocked. He left several bottles of wine, and waters and OJ. Frozen pizzas, cereals and other food for us. Really delightful and unexpected.
There were plenty of bedrooms and air mattresses to go around. Apparently the mattresses are new (2016).

BEST PLACE IN DALLS

Where to start... anything and everything from communication prior to the arrival to closing up on our final day Paul was the most accommodating host I have ever seen. The house was completely clean and spacious, but it was the details that blew me away; extra hair dryers for the ladies that stayed with us (which ended up really coming in need!), extra towels, blankets (which we also ended up using), cleaning products, extra coffee pots in case we didn't want decaf, and the fridge had drinks and snacks in it in case we weren't able to make it to the store our first night... again which REALLY came in handy! A total five star guest service experience. I will never stay in another hotel in Dallas. We had a large group of people and were still all very comfortable, the layout of the house allows plenty of room for everyone. Beds were comfortable, plenty of bathrooms, lots of games, and extremely affordable. Not a single thing could be done to make this experience better. This guy has it figured out. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! I cant wait to come back.
