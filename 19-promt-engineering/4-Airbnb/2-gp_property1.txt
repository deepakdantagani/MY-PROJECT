My family and I had a great stay! Enjoyed the private pool and the private area to park in the garage. Which fit an SUV and a GMC Crew Cab truck perfectly. The ability to have cool AC and hot water was the best. The water pressure was a game changer. There were basic essentials for a quick meal in the kitchen. The beds were comfortable and very well decorated. The pool was the highlight, we got in everyday of our stay and it was the right size/depth and temp. Teri was fantastic and a great host from the time I booked and until the time I left. Not overbearing or difficult and communicated when necessary, I truly appreciated Teri as a host. This is a must stay for sure, we would definitely book again.

Teri was amazing and the place was perfect. The pool during the week of 110 degree heat was great.

Everything about this house was amazing. The location was centraly located to the airport, Downtown, Uptown, and Fort Worth. Everything was nice and clean, and having the pool was perfect! Teri was great to work with! I would definitely book again next time to Dallas!

Teri's home was a great spot for gathering our family to attend a family event and very convenient for multiple runs to DFW. In the Texas heat we really appreciated being able to load and unload from the connected garage. Teri is a gracious and conscientious host. She responded quickly to questions, even at midnight to one that couldn't wait until the next day. We would definitely stay there again.

We had a great stay at Teri’s place in Grand Prairie. The pool & outdoor space was awesome! The rooms & beds were comfortable. The place was clean & exactly like the pictures. We loved the location-close to Six Flags, shopping, Rangers & Cowboys Stadiums. We hope to come back next year!

We had the best time at Teri’s place…perfect location and accommodations were great. We had 9 people from ages 17-55. The outside area was perfect, too. Teri was very prompt and even brought us new remotes within an hour of us getting there because the other tenants before us misplaced them.
We would stay here again in a heartbeat!

Our group of 7 were extremely pleased with the place for a long weekend stay. 1) Teri was very responsive and flexible. 2) The place had several different places to convene and talk as a group or smaller cluster of friends. For example, two dining tables -- kitchen and dining room -- the the main living room, hot-tub/pool, patio sofa and firepit. 3) The premises felt spacious.

Nothing but good things to say about the rental. The house was very nice. Plenty of space. The backyard was where we spent most the time. The pool and hot tub were awesome! Had a little trouble heating the pool the first night but figured it out the next day. We would definitely stay here again if we need a place in the area!

Teri was great to work with. She responded quickly to all my questions. The kitchen was well stocked, and even had some spices. The location made it easy to get to everywhere in the metroplex. Despite the cool temperatures, the grandkids loved the spa and heated pool, they were a real winner.

Not only was this ADORABLE place inviting and modern but the host was a PLEASURE to work with and even checked in with us when a horrible storm went thru the area. I cannot recommend Teri and the location enough! All our guests with our party were overly impressed and stated that this was one of the BEST we’ve ever stayed in! Very close to DSW and not far from DAL. We HATED leaving! Thanks, Teri!!!

What a wonderful stay we had in Texas! This place was spacious yet also gave you plenty of room to gather together and socialize. The pool and hot tub were great. Our teenage girls really enjoyed it. The neighborhood is quiet and quaint. We would definitely stay again! Great hosts. Very informative and attentive. Even the lady who serviced the pool was super sweet and helpful. Great Experience.

We had a wonderful time at this Airbnb. It was roomy and comfy. Lots of space for our 10 family members to enjoy. We had a few issues but the owner was quick to respond. We would love to return when the weather is warmer to enjoy the beautiful back yard and pool. This is a wonderful place for any group!

Teri has really set a HIGH bar of standard for us for Airbnb. The place was beautiful and tastefully decorated. It is apparent that a lot of thought in making sure the place feel like home. This place was a great respite for my family and I. If we had any questions or concerns, Teri answered them quickly and problem solved with us. We wish we could of stayed longer!
