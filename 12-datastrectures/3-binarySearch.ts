/**
 * reduce the search space by half, then we can use the
 * find the range
 * if we do x+2 then it is linear time complexity, if we do x*2, this will be a log(x) complexity in the binary search
 * dont implement recursession for the binary search, bacaue it will us the more stack space.
 * after doing binay search on the same set of daya twice, the time time complexity will still be the same. x(log(n)) ==> log(n)
