//there is answer in the question
//take more example before write the logic
//understand the constructor, once instantiated, it should have all the info
//be careful in the loop of trying to access next values, could cause array index out of bound errors
//in numbers, we can access last digit with modulo
// remove the last number using division
//check for redue the process of half
//remove unwanted variables
//consider all edge cases and write them down, check the examples and constraints
//read the question very carefully, find the hints, find all methods, understand the problem with examples too.
//if some opration is repeating, we can comeup with the alternative approch
//check the if conditional carefully
//explain through the time complexity
//if we do x+2 then it is linear time complexity, if we do x*2, this will be a log(x) complexity in the binary search
//work more on the if conditions
//more practice on if else and visualze the logic
//look for other solutions
//time complexity = log(m)*log(n)
//edge cases for 1 value and last value
// **** when convert 2d array in to 1d array, r = index/n; c= index%n;
// in mapping, if a is mapped to b, in some cases we need to make sure b is not mapped to any other key too.
// if the code has multiple of values in the loop, it might have a constraint to max out, so use long and check the range or other solutions
//for all the solutions of the hashmap, check if it is possible to reduse the soluctionto hashset
//in binary search, find a reason to reduce the search to half
